- [x] parse tiger data
- [ ] consider DSL?? for filters etc.
- [x] vim/tokei plugin? 
- [ ] data type for Region, not just District
- [x] Compute.hs -> Hylo.hs
- [x] read a .shp object when a dbf file doesn't exist.
  - [ ] take in dimensions of 
- [x] generate a .png from tiger data (for debugging)
  - [x] label interiors somehow?
  - [ ] projections
    - [x] math.project module??
    - [x] craig retroazimuthal
    - [ ] gnomonic
    - [x] littrow
    - [x] fix mercator
    - [ ] gall stereographic
    - [ ] Peirce quincuncial
    - [ ] eckert IV
    - [ ] Mollweide
    - [ ] robinson
    - [ ] transverse mercator
    - [x] winkel triple
    - [ ] Kavrayskiy VII
    - [ ] Bottomley
    - [ ] Werner
    - [ ] sinusoidal? 
    - [ ] what projection distorts compactness minimally?
- [x] generate a .svg with diagrams backend
  - [x] also have flag to optionally install cairo parts (so no need for unhaskell!)
- [ ] measure compactness mathematically :)
  - [ ] current method
    - [x] measure perimeter
    - [ ] measure area
    - [ ] measure area of circumscribed circle? 
  - [ ] fractal dimension
  - [ ] concavity obviously
  - [ ] look at what's been done already w.r.t. appealing to justices (integrate other voter data? also account "how close" they are to distr. rather than just dem/rep)
- [ ] consider an optimizing program to show non-gerrymandered districts
- [ ] haddock
- [ ] yesod etc. webapp would be really good for public engagement
  - [ ] would require elm/purescript though :|
- [ ] LaTeX for the tutorial?
